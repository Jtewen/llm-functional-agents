    Analyzes the provided raw invoice text and extracts structured information.
    This includes details like invoice ID, vendor and customer names, issue and due dates,
    a list of line items (each with description, quantity, unit price, total price),
    the subtotal (sum of line items), tax_amount, and the overall total_amount_due.
    Dates should be in YYYY-MM-DD format. Currency symbols should be captured.
    Numeric values (prices, quantities, subtotal, tax, total) should be parsed as floats.

    The LLM should generate Python code to perform this extraction.
    The generated Python code must assign its final result (an instance of ExtractedInvoice
    or a dictionary that can be converted to it) to a variable named `llm_output`.

    Key financial fields to extract:
    - `line_items`: Each item should have `description`, `quantity`, `unit_price`, `total_price`.
    - `subtotal`: This should be the sum of all `line_item.total_price`.
    - `tax_amount`: Extract any specified tax amount. If tax is given as a percentage, calculate the amount.
                   If no tax is mentioned, this can be 0 or None.
    - `total_amount_due`: The final amount. This should ideally be consistent with subtotal + tax_amount.

    If specific fields cannot be found, they should be omitted (set to None or default value if applicable, e.g., 0 for tax_amount if none specified).
    Pay attention to the relationships between financial fields as per the assertion hooks that will be run on your output.
